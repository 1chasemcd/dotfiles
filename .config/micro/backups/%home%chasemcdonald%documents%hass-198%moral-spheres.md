# Moral Spheres

Allows us to analyze who is deserving of ethical treatment

* Family near center of sphere
    * Rooted in Basic family relationship
    * Common to other animals
* Then ingroup, strangers, species, and all living things
    * Outer rings require special way of thinking - "Principle of Interchangeable Perspectives"
    * Look at the world from their perspective

Rise of science and technology and passage of time has increased extension of ethical treatment

# Questions

1. Consider the moral spheres chart. Do you agree with its structure? Do you believe it is an accurate representation of contemporary moral spheres? Would you rearrange it or change it in any way?

I don't fully agree with the arrangement of the moral spheres diagram shown in the video. I think that many people in modern society would actually be more willing to extend ethical consideration toward members of their ingroup (their friends) than they would towards members of their extended family, such as great great great grandparents. I think the model presented in the video may have been more accurate in the past when the age of first childbirth was lower than it is now (source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db21.pdf). For instance, I recall learning in history class that in Ancient China, due to a lower age of childbirth, four or more generations would be alive at the same time, and would often live in the same household. This would strengthen relationships to extended family members such as great grandparents.

Now though, the age that people choose to have children at is much higher, so many probably feel less connected to their extended family. Personally, I don't even know the names of my family members beyond my great grandparents, and I don't think I would prioritize ethical consideration towards them above that of my closest friends.

2. Trolley Problem Response

I find it much easier to justify switching the direction of the trolley so that it only hits one person than pushing a person off the bridge to stop the train. I think my reasoning behind this is that working on a tolley track is inherently more risky than just standing on a bridge. When the workers are on the track, they are probably aware that there is a chance of a trolly approaching at some point, whereas the person on the bridge is just a bystander who would never expect to get hit by a trolly. To be honest, this logic is probably flawed, but for some reason, pushing a single person off a bridge to save 5 seems unethical. If I personally knew one of the people, I would probably change my selection to save that person. My moral sphere places people I know closer to the center than strangers, so I would choose those I know first.

3. Moral Machine Activity

When making decisions on the moral machine activity, I found it easiest to take the utilitarian route and save the most people possible.
